                <h5>From the LinkedIn Learning courses to Accountability & Dependability, ASPIRE has impacted my personal and professional growth.</h5>

                    <p>Starting with creating my “why” statement. Understanding my “why” helped me recognize my purpose, passion, and beliefs and how those impact the customers I serve. I was able to reflect and think about Why I do the work I do and why I continue to do it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="impact-2">
                    <p>The following session on Integrity and being my authentic self was eye opening. Working through the decision matrix in the small discussion group brought out some great conversations about having to do the right thing even though it wasn’t popular. Being able to talk through that really helped me understand authenticity and what that looks like in and out of the workplace. Knowing my story and creating my personal brand was one of my favorite post-work activities. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>The ASPIRE session on Accountability & Dependability really impacted me and challenged some of my existing beliefs on being accountable. Minding the gap in accountability helped me understand how the way we show up impacts our reliability and dependability. I knew accountability takes courage and vulnerability, but I really did not understand how others might perceive accountability, so it was really cool to go through that.</p>

                    <p>Before participating in the ASPIRE Program, I viewed excellence primarily as achieving high standards and results. Now, I understand it as a holistic approach that encompasses teamwork, integrity, adaptability, accountability and dependability. Excellence is no longer just about personal achievements but about uplifting those around me and contributing to a positive team environment.</p>

                <div class="reflection-2">
                    <p>One of the key lessons from the ASPIRE Program has been the importance of effective communication. I’ve learned to actively listen and engage with my teammates, fostering an atmosphere where everyone feels valued and heard.</p>

                <div class="reflection-3">
                    <p>I have grown significantly in my ability to adapt. My growth in adaptability has transformed my approach to both work and personal interactions. By embracing change, developing a flexible mindset, learning from setbacks, and building stronger relationships, I feel more equipped to navigate the complexities of any situation. This journey has reinforced my belief that adaptability is not just a skill; it's a mindset that fosters resilience and growth.</p>

                <div class="reflection-4">
                    <p>I will move the mission forward by embodying the values I’ve learned in ASPIRE and encouraging my teammates to do the same. I plan to take on more team building activities, where I will commit myself to fostering an inclusive and communicative environment. I will share my ASPIRE journey and the lessons I’ve learned with my colleagues. By highlighting the importance of teamwork, integrity, and accountability. I hope to motivate others to embrace these principles and become champions of our collective goals.</p>

                    <p>Moving forward, I plan to set specific goals for myself, focusing on both professional development and leading in place. I will continue to seek opportunities for growth, attend workshops, and engage in discussions that align with our mission, ensuring that the momentum from ASPIRE continues to propel us forward. In conclusion, the ASPIRE Program has profoundly impacted my understanding of excellence and teamwork. I am excited to apply these insights and inspire others on our journey together.</p>
